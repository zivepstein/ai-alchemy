											<h3>Prof. Simon Colton</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/simon.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Simon Colton is a professor of computational creativity, generative artist and app developer. He has academic appointments at Queen Mary University of London in the UK and at SensiLab of Monash University in Australia. He was previously an academic at Falmouth University, Goldsmiths College and Imperial College London. He is an AI researcher with 25 years of experience studying questions related to creativity in machines.</p>

											<h3>Dr. Aaron Hertzmann</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/ahertz.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Aaron Hertzmann is a Principal Scientist at Adobe and Affiliate Faculty at University of Washington. He received a BA in computer science and art history from Rice University in 1996, and a PhD in computer science from New York University in 2001. He was a Professor at University of Toronto for 10 years, and has also worked at Pixar Animation Studios and Microsoft Research. He has published over 100 papers in computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning, robotics, human-computer interaction, and art. He is an ACM Fellow and an IEEE Fellow.</p>

											<h3>Ryan Murdock</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/ryan.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Ryan, also known as '@advadnoun' on Twitter, authored the 'BigSleep' Google Colab notebook and also pioneered the approach of combining VQGAN with CLIP to guide image generation. This was an important milestone in the community led development of text-to-image technologies. Ryan is a Machine Learning researcher & engineer interested in art, culture, and cognitive science. His passion is advocating for text-guided visual art as a compelling new medium.</p>

											<h3>Mike Cook</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/mike.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Mike works at the intersection of automated game design and computational creativity – he’s interested in how computers can be autonomously creative in the field of game design, and how we can use AI to assist and analyse generative software written by humans. He gained his PhD from Imperial College in 2015, and in 2018 was awarded a Research Fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering, to research applications of automated game design to industry-scale game development at Queen Mary.</p>

											<h3>Dr. Kate Compton</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/kate2.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Dr Kate Compton (@galaxykate) is a long-time generative artist, inventor, programmer, and Assistant Professor of Instruction at Northwestern University. She wrote the first paper on procedural platform-game levels, generated the planets for the video game Spore, created the language Tracery which runs over 10000 community-made bots on Twitter, and invented an early phone-based AR system. Her mission is to design artificial intelligence to augment human creativity, and to create tools that bring AI into the hands of poets, artists, kids, and weirdos.</p>

											<h3>Dr. Anna Jordanous</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/anna.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Dr Anna Jordanous is a senior lecturer in the School of Computing at the University of Kent. She is a member of the Computational Intelligence and Data Science research groups. Her research areas include computational creativity and its evaluation, music informatics, digital humanities, knowledge modelling, Semantic Web, and natural language processing. Primarily she works with computational creativity - the modelling, simulation or replication of creative activities and behaviour using computational means - with a focus on the question of how to evaluate claims of computer software being creative. As well as writing creative software to improvise music, Dr Jordanous has contributed a highly-cited standardised procedure for evaluating creative systems. She also uses music information retrieval and natural language processing in her work.</p>
